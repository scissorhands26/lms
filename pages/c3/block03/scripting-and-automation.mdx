# Scripting and Automation Cyber Crash Course

## Workflow Automation
- Regular tasks can often be automated to save time and effort.
- **Examples of automation:**
  - **Excel functions:** Automate calculations and data processing using formulas, pivot tables, and conditional formatting.
  - **Command line tools:** Automate data retrieval from web services, perform batch file operations, and process text files.
  - **API scripts:** Automate creation, retrieval, or updating of information through API calls, enabling integration with web services and applications.

## Automation Tools
- Automation tools are widely available and can range from simple to complex.
- Automating even a portion of a process can save considerable time.
- **Tools include:**
  - **Productivity tools:**
    - **Excel:** Utilize functions, macros, and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate repetitive tasks and complex calculations.
    - **PowerPoint:** Create slideshows programmatically, update slides with new data, and automate repetitive presentation tasks using VBA.
    - **Word:** Automate document formatting, template creation, and repetitive text manipulation tasks using macros and VBA.
    - **Power Automate:** Create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more.
    - **PowerBI:** Automate data refreshes, report generation, and dashboard updates using built-in automation features and custom scripts.
  - **Command line tools:**
    - **`curl`:** Transfer data from or to a server using various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.).
    - **`jq`:** Command-line JSON processor that allows you to slice, filter, map, and transform JSON data.
    - **`sed` / `awk`:** Stream editors and pattern scanning/processing languages used for text manipulation and data extraction.
  - **Scripting languages:**
    - **bash:** Unix shell and command language for writing simple scripts to automate command execution on Unix-like systems.
    - **PowerShell:** Task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language.
    - **Batch (Windows cmd):** Simple scripting language for Windows command line to automate basic tasks and command sequences.
    - **Python:** High-level programming language known for its readability and versatility, used for scripting, web development, data analysis, and more.

## Scripting
- Scripting involves writing a series of commands in a programming or scripting language.
- Scripts can use existing system executables and built-in commands of the scripting language.

### Types of Scripting
- **Bash Scripts:** 
  - Use system executables (`curl`, `grep`, `cat`, etc.) and built-in bash commands.
  - Support logic and control flow mechanisms like loops and conditionals.
  - Example: 
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Creating directory"
    mkdir new_directory
    find . -name "*.txt" -exec mv {} new_directory \;
    gzip new_directory/*.txt
    ```
- **PowerShell Scripts:** 
  - Use system executables and provide robust interaction with libraries, logic, and control flow.
  - Integrates with Windows management infrastructure (e.g., WMI, COM objects).
  - Example:
    ```powershell
    Write-Output "Creating directory"
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "new_directory"
    Get-ChildItem -Filter *.txt | Move-Item -Destination "new_directory"
    Get-ChildItem "new_directory\*.txt" | Compress-Archive -DestinationPath "new_directory\archive.zip"
    ```
- **Batch Scripts:** 
  - Use system executables and built-in commands.
  - Suitable for simple automation tasks in Windows environments.
  - Example:
    ```batch
    @echo off
    echo Creating directory
    mkdir new_directory
    forfiles /M *.txt /C "cmd /c move @file new_directory"
    forfiles /P new_directory /M *.txt /C "cmd /c gzip @file"
    ```
- **Python Scripts:** 
  - Use libraries rather than system executables, offering a wide range of functionalities.
  - Ideal for complex automation tasks, data manipulation, and web interactions.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    data = response.json()
    for item in data:
        print(item['name'])
    ```

## Benefits of Scripting
- Scripting can automate complex tasks and provide more control than built-in automation features of tools like Excel.
- Initial investment in effort can lead to significant time savings in the long run.
- **Common uses:**
  - **bash, batch, and PowerShell:** Automate groups of commands you might run regularly, such as system maintenance, file manipulation, and data processing.
  - **Python:** Handle tasks like file manipulation, web scraping, data analysis, API interaction, and complex automation workflows.
