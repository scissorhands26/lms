# Logic and Databases Cyber Crash Course

## What is a Database?

- A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically.
- **Key characteristics:**
  - **Storage:** Information is stored in a specific file format, which includes metadata (data about the data) and the actual data.
  - **Types of data:**
    - **Strings:** Text data, such as names, addresses, and descriptions.
    - **Numbers:** Numerical data, such as prices, quantities, and measurements.
    - **Binary blobs:** Binary large objects, such as images, videos, and other files.

## Why Use a Database?

- Databases provide a rigid structure, comparable to a table or spreadsheet with rows and columns.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Fast and efficient searches:** Quickly retrieve specific information using indexed data.
  - **Easy relation of information:** Enables complex queries to relate different pieces of data. For example:
    - Finding all residents in a city aged 25-50.
    - Retrieving all phone numbers in a city, grouped by area code.
  - **Scalable:** Efficiently handle large datasets. Example: SQLite can manage up to 140 terabytes of data.

## Types of Databases

- **Commonly used databases and their file extensions:**
  - **Relational Databases:**
    - **Oracle:** `.dbf` - A robust, enterprise-level database known for handling large volumes of data.
    - **MySQL:** `.idb`, `.myd` - An open-source relational database management system widely used for web applications.
    - **PostgreSQL:** `.sql` - An advanced open-source relational database with strong support for complex queries and large data volumes.
  - **NoSQL Databases:**
    - **MongoDB:** `.ns.0`, `.1`, etc. - A NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
    - **CouchDB:** Uses JSON to store data, JavaScript for MapReduce indexes, and regular HTTP for its API.
  - **Embedded Databases:**
    - **SQLite:** `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db` - A lightweight, disk-based database that's self-contained and easy to use.
  - **Enterprise Databases:**
    - **Microsoft SQL Server:** `.mdf`, `.ndf` - A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, known for its scalability and integration with other Microsoft products.
  - **Mobile/Embedded Databases:**
    - **PocketBase:** `.db` - A small, versatile database designed for embedded systems and mobile applications.

## Interacting with Databases

- Interaction varies based on the database type; some use SQL, others use more flexible formats like JSON, XML, or YAML.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):**
  - The standard language for relational databases.
  - Allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data.
  - Examples include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **NoSQL Databases:**
  - Often use JSON for data storage and retrieval.
  - Designed for flexibility and scalability, handling unstructured data.
- **Schema Understanding:**
  - Knowing the structure of your data is crucial for effective querying.
  - Schema defines how data is organized, including tables, fields, and relationships.

### MySQL Table Schema Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    cust_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    occupation VARCHAR(50)
);
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `cust_id INT PRIMARY KEY`: Defines a unique identifier for each customer.
  - `first_name VARCHAR(50)`, `last_name VARCHAR(50)`: Define text fields for the customer's first and last names, with a maximum length of 50 characters.
  - `email VARCHAR(100)`: Defines a text field for the customer's email, with a maximum length of 100 characters.
  - `age INT`: Defines a numerical field for the customer's age.
  - `occupation VARCHAR(50)`: Defines a text field for the customer's occupation, with a maximum length of 50 characters.

### MongoDB Document Schema Example

```json
{
  "cust_id": 1,
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "occupation": "Engineer"
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - **JSON format:** Documents are stored in a JSON-like format, allowing for flexibility in the types of data stored.
  - `cust_id`: Unique identifier for the customer.
  - `first_name`, `last_name`: Text fields for the customer's first and last names.
  - `email`: Text field for the customer's email.
  - `age`: Numerical field for the customer's age.
  - `occupation`: Text field for the customer's occupation.

## The Logic of Databases

- Queries retrieve information using schema identifiers. For example, you might query information about `cust_id` or `first_name`. You couldn't try to query something like `cust_address`, because it was not specified in the schema.
- **Simple queries:**
  - Basic data retrieval.
  - **Example MySQL Query:** Retrieves all `cust_id` from the `customers` table
    ```mysql
    SELECT cust_id FROM customers
    ```
  - **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**
    ```json
    db.customers.find({}, { cust_id: 1, _id: 0 })
    ```

### Logic Operators

- **AND (`&&`)**: Results are returned only if all conditions are met.
  - **Example:** Retrieve customers who are doctors and aged 37.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE occupation = 'Doctor' AND age = 37;
    ```
  - **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**
    ```json
    db.customers.find({ occupation: 'Doctor', age: 37 })
    ```
- **OR (`||`)**: Results are returned if at least one condition is met.
  - **Example:** Retrieve customers who are musicians or named John Doe.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE occupation = 'Musician' OR name = 'John Doe';
    ```
  - **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**
    ```json
    db.customers.find({ $or: [ { occupation: 'Musician' }, { name: 'John Doe' } ] })
    ```
- **NOT (`!`)**: Results are returned if the condition is false.
  - **Example:** Retrieve customers who are not engineers.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE NOT occupation = 'Engineer';
    ```
  - **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**
    ```json
    db.customers.find({ occupation: { $ne: 'Engineer' } })
    ```
- **Combining operators:** Complex queries using multiple conditions.
  - **Example:** Retrieve doctors who are not aged 45 or customers named Evan Green.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (occupation = 'Doctor' AND NOT age = 45) OR name = 'Evan Green';
    ```
  - **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**
    ```json
    db.customers.find({
      $or: [
        { occupation: 'Doctor', age: { $ne: 45 } },
        { name: 'Evan Green' }
      ]
    })
    ```

### Examples of Complex Queries

- **Example 1:** Retrieve customers who are either engineers or doctors, aged between 30 and 50, and live in a specific city.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  WHERE (occupation = 'Engineer' OR occupation = 'Doctor')
  AND age BETWEEN 30 AND 50
  AND city = 'New York';
  ```
- **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**

```json
db.customers.find({
$and: [
{ $or: [ { occupation: 'Engineer' }, { occupation: 'Doctor' } ] },
{ age: { $gte: 30, $lte: 50 } },
{ city: 'New York' }
]
})
```

- **Example 2:** Retrieve customers who have made purchases above a certain amount and have a specified membership status.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  INNER JOIN purchases ON customers.cust_id = purchases.cust_id
  WHERE purchases.amount > 1000
  AND customers.membership_status = 'Gold';
  ```
- **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**

```json
db.customers.aggregate([
{
$lookup: {
  from: 'purchases',
  localField: 'cust_id',
  foreignField: 'cust_id',
  as: 'customer_purchases'
}
},
{ $unwind: '$customer_purchases' },
{
$match: {
  'customer_purchases.amount': { $gt: 1000 },
  membership_status: 'Gold'
}
}
])
```

- **Example 3:** Retrieve customers who have not made any purchases in the last year.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  WHERE cust_id NOT IN (
      SELECT cust_id FROM purchases
      WHERE purchase_date > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
  );
  ```
- **Equivalent NoSQL Query (MongoDB):**

```json
db.customers.find({
cust_id: {
$nin: db.purchases.distinct('cust_id', {
  purchase_date: { $gt: new Date(Date.now() - 365*24*60*60*1000) }
})
}
})
```
