## Network Topology

Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. It defines how different nodes are connected and how data is transmitted from one node to another. There are several types of network topologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common network topologies include:

| Topology | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bus      | All devices are connected to a single cable called a bus. Data is transmitted in both directions along the bus.                                         |
| Star     | All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data is transmitted from one device to the hub, which then forwards it to the destination device. |
| Ring     | Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data is transmitted in one direction around the ring.                                    |
| Mesh     | Each device is connected to every other device in the network, providing redundant paths for data to travel.                                            |

Essentially all modern networks use a combination of these topologies to meet their specific requirements. For example, a large enterprise network might use a combination of star and mesh topologies to provide high performance and fault tolerance.

## LAN vs WAN

Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) are two common types of networks that differ in terms of their size and scope. Here are some key differences between LAN and WAN:

| LAN                                     | WAN                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Limited geographical area               | Covers a large geographical area   |
| Typically used within a single building | Spans multiple cities or countries |
| High data transfer speeds               | Lower data transfer speeds         |
| Lower latency                           | Higher latency                     |
| Lower cost                              | Higher cost                        |
| Easier to manage and secure             | More complex to manage and secure  |

## Networking Devices

Networking devices such as routers, switches, and access points are used to connect different nodes in a network. These devices play a crucial role in determining how data is transmitted across the network. Here are some common networking devices and their functions:

- **Router**: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and uses routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.
- **Switch**: A switch is a networking device that connects devices within a local area network (LAN). It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to forward data packets to the correct destination.
- **Access Point**: An access point is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model and provides wireless connectivity to devices within its range.
