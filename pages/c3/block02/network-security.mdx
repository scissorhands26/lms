## What is Network Security

Network security refers to the practice of securing a computer network infrastructure against unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of service. It involves implementing various technologies, processes, and policies to protect the network and the data it carries. In this context, it refers to devices that are connected to the network, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

## Firewalls

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the Internet, to prevent unauthorized access and protect against cyber threats.

### Types of Firewalls

#### Host Based Firewalls

Host-based firewalls are installed on individual devices, such as computers or servers, to control network traffic to and from that device. They provide an additional layer of security by filtering traffic at the device level.

#### Network Based Firewalls

Network-based firewalls are dedicated hardware devices or software applications that protect an entire network by filtering traffic at the network level. They are typically deployed at the network perimeter to secure incoming and outgoing traffic.

#### Stateful Firewalls

Stateful firewalls monitor the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic. They keep track of the state of network connections and only allow traffic that matches an existing connection state.

#### Stateless Firewalls

Stateless firewalls filter traffic based on predefined rules without considering the state of the connection. They do not maintain connection state information and evaluate each packet in isolation.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. It detects and alerts administrators about potential security threats in real-time, allowing them to respond promptly to prevent security breaches.

### Types of IDS

#### Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activities or patterns that indicate a potential security threat. They analyze network packets and traffic flows to detect and alert on malicious activities.

#### Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)

Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) monitor activities on individual devices, such as computers or servers, to detect unauthorized access or malicious activities. They analyze system logs, file integrity, and system calls to identify security incidents.

## Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)

An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and takes action to prevent security threats. It is an advanced version of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can automatically respond to detected threats by blocking or mitigating them.

### Types of IPS

#### Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS)

Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS) are security appliances or software applications that monitor network traffic for malicious activities and take action to prevent security threats. They can block or drop malicious traffic in real-time to protect the network.

#### Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)

Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS) are security tools installed on individual devices, such as computers or servers, to monitor and prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities. They provide an additional layer of security by analyzing system activities and taking action to protect the device.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a comprehensive approach to security management that combines the capabilities of security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into a single solution. It provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.

### Key Features of SIEM

#### Log Management

SIEM systems collect, store, and analyze log data from various sources, such as network devices, servers, and applications. They provide centralized log management to help organizations monitor and investigate security incidents.

#### Event Correlation

SIEM systems correlate security events from different sources to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate a security threat. They use advanced analytics to detect and alert on potential security incidents.

#### Incident Response

SIEM systems provide incident response capabilities to help organizations respond to security incidents promptly. They enable security teams to investigate alerts, analyze security events, and take action to mitigate threats.

#### Compliance Reporting

SIEM systems help organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements by providing detailed reports on security events, incidents, and activities. They generate compliance reports to demonstrate adherence to security policies and standards.

### Examples of SIEM Solutions

- Splunk
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- ArcSight
- Wuzah
