## What is Network Mapping

Network mapping is the process of creating a visual representation or diagram of a computer network. It involves identifying and documenting the devices, connections, and configurations within the network infrastructure. This visual map helps network engineers and administrators understand the layout of the network, its components, and how they interact with each other.
Key Items in Network Mapping:

    - **Devices and Hosts:**
        Identify and list all devices connected to the network, such as routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and any other networked devices.
    - **Connections:**
        Map out the physical and logical connections between devices. This includes Ethernet cables, fiber optics, wireless connections, and virtual connections established through protocols like VLANs or VPNs.
    - **IP Addresses and Subnets:**
        Document IP addresses assigned to each device and the subnetting scheme used within the network. Understanding IP addressing helps in troubleshooting and managing network traffic effectively.
    - **Network Topology:**
        Visualize the network topology, which describes how devices are interconnected. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid configurations.
    - **Services and Applications:**
        Note down critical network services and applications running on servers or hosted by devices. This could include DNS servers, DHCP servers, email servers, databases, and web services.
    - **Security Devices and Policies:**
        Identify security devices such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and access control lists (ACLs). Document security policies and configurations to ensure network security and compliance.

## Importance of Network Mapping

    - **Visualization and Understanding:**
        Provides a clear visual representation of the network architecture, helping network engineers understand the layout, relationships, and dependencies between devices.
    - **Troubleshooting and Diagnosis:**
        Facilitates quick identification of network issues and troubleshooting by pinpointing where problems occur, such as faulty connections, misconfigured devices, or network congestion.
    - **Capacity Planning:**
        Enables capacity planning by showing device utilization, traffic patterns, and potential bottlenecks. This helps in optimizing network performance and scalability.
    - **Security Analysis:**
        Enhances network security by identifying potential vulnerabilities, unauthorized devices, or insecure configurations. It allows for proactive security measures to protect against threats.
    - **Documentation and Compliance:**
        Serves as a comprehensive documentation tool for network administrators and auditors. It ensures compliance with organizational standards, facilitates audits, and supports disaster recovery planning.

## Tools and Techniques for Network Mapping

    - **Manual Mapping:** Using tools like pen and paper or diagramming software to manually draw network diagrams based on gathered information.
    - **Automated Mapping Tools:** Utilizing specialized software or network management tools (e.g., SolarWinds, Nagios) that automatically discover and map the network topology, devices, and connections.
