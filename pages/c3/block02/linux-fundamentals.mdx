# Linux Fundamentals

## What is Linux?

Linux, an open-source kernel originally developed by Linus Torvalds, allows for easy modification to fit various needs while remaining highly efficient. As a result, it has become a popular choice for uses such as servers, data centers, virtualization, containers, high-performance computing, and embedded systems.

## Linux History

Linux, created in the early 1990s by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), emerged as an alternative to the UNIX operating system. While still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds began developing Linux with the goal of creating a system similar to MINIX. The initial release of Linux consisted of a kernel, which later became the foundation for the complete operating system we know today.

## Linux Distributions

Various groups and institutions have leveraged the Linux kernel to create their own operating systems, commonly referred to as distributions. Itâ€™s crucial to recognize that the functionality of a computer can significantly vary based on the chosen distribution. These differences may include variations in system initialization software, file systems, default shells, and available binaries.

| Distribution       | Year | Based On                 | Release type    | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debian             | 1993 | N/A                      | Stable Release  | One of the oldest and most influential Linux distributions.                                                                       |
| Red Hat            | 1994 | N/A                      | Stable Release  | A commercial distribution known for its system administration and security tools, with enterprise features.                       |
| Arch Linux         | 2002 | N/A                      | Rolling Release | A minimalist and user-centric distribution that requires significant manual configuration.                                        |
| Fedora             | 2003 | Red Hat Linux            | Stable Release  | The open-source counterpart to Red Hat Linux; designed to promote innovation.                                                     |
| Ubuntu             | 2004 | Debian                   | Stable Release  | The most widely used distribution for desktop Linux.                                                                              |
| CentOS (now Rocky) | 2004 | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Rolling Release | Originally designed to bridge the gap between Fedora and RHEL; later forked into Rocky due to a shift to a rolling release cycle. |
| openSUSE           | 2005 | SUSE Linux               | Stable Release  | Focuses on ease of use and stability; popular in enterprise environments.                                                         |

You can check system distribution using a few commands: `uname -a`,`cat /etc/*release*`, or `lsb_release -a`.

## Common Linux Processes

Understanding common Linux processes is essential for analysts make decisions about what is legitimate and what may be malicious.

Things to know:
Processes in brackets (Ex. [khtreadd]) arre kernel threads. These are directly controlled by the Linux kernel.
Processes ending in the letter d (Ex. sshd or syslogd) are daemons. These are background processes that don't require interaction and are usually providing some kind of system service.

Here are some key Linux processes and their descriptions:

F S UID PID PPID C PRI NI ADDR SZ WCHAN STIME TTY TIME CMD
4 S root 1 0 0 80 0 - 9943 - 18:00 ? 00:00:02 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd

| UID             | PID | PPID | CMD                         | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --- | ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| root            | 1   | 0    | /usr/lib/systemd/systemd    | System daemon process is responsible for managing processes and services. PID will always be 1 and PPID always 0.       |
| root            | 2   | 0    | [kthreadd]                  | Responsible for the creation of new kernel threads. PID will always be 2 and PPID always 0.                             |
| root/systemd-\* | \*  | 1    | /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-\* | There will be a variety of systemd services running, they will have different PIDs but they should all have a PPID of 1 |
| root            | \*  | 1    | /usr/sbin/gdm3              | Gnome                                                                                                                   |

| colord          |     |      |                             |                                                                                                                         |
|                 |     |      |                             |                                                                                                                         |

You can look at a list of running processes using the command `ps -elf`.

### Important Points for Analysts

- **Paths**: If the process is not located in the expected directory, it may be suspicious.
- **System Idle Process**: This process is not harmful. It shows the percentage of time the CPU is idle.
- **svchost.exe**: Multiple instances of this process can run simultaneously. Each instance can host different services.
- **explorer.exe**: Responsible for the desktop and file management. Restarting this process can resolve issues with the taskbar and desktop.

### Important Points for Analysts

## Linux File Systems

Linux systems use a variety of different file system depending on the intended use and preferrences. Here are some of the most common file systems used on Linux devices.

**Ext4**: Most commonly used file system and is the default for many Linux distributions. It is stable and reliable but considered outdated when compared to other modern file systems.
**Btrfs**: B-Tree File System offers features that focus on scalability, fault tolerance, and data integrity.
**XFS**: Works well with large files and works well with real-time applications, but it is at a disadvantage when storing a large number of smaller files.
**ZFS**: Provides better scalability and data redundancy when compared to Btrfs, this comes at the cost of requiring more resources to run at sufficient speed.

df, lsblk, mount, file, fstab

### Directory Structure

The Linux file system is organized into a hierarchical directory structure, using `/` as the top level known as the root of the filesystem or simply root. Here are some common directories found in Linux:

| **Directory** | **Description**                                                                                                                   |

| **/dev**      | Contains special files related to devices. These files are virtual and not physically on disk.                                    |
| **/home**     | Contains all the system users' personal data.                                                                                     |
| **/tmp**      | Used to store temporary files. The contents of this directory are deleted when the system restarts.                               |
| **/var**      | Short for variable, this is where programs can store tuntime information such as logging, caches, web pages, databases, and more. |
| **/proc**     | Contains information about currently running processes and kernel parameters                                                      |
| **/root**     | Works as the home directory for the root user.                                                                                    |

You can use the command `ls -latr /` to view the top level directories.

### Additional Directories and Files to Know

- **/etc/passwd**: Stores user account information.
- **/etc/shadow**: Stores password hashes for he user accounts.

## Linux Logging

Linux has a variety of logging mechanisms available to help administrators and analysts monitor events. Understanding these logging mechanisms can help make sense of system activity

### Common Linux Logging Mechanisms

**syslog**: Standard logging protocol used to collect messages from variour system components, applications, and services.
**rsyslog**: Enhanced version of syslog, providing some additional features and more flexible configuration.
**system journal**: Implemented by systemd, the system journal is a centralized logging system that stores logs in binary format.
**auditing**: Framework that allows for monitoring and recording system events related to security, user activity, and system changes.
**process accounting**: Tracks resource usage such as CPU time and memory for individual processes and records them.
**kernel logging**: Contains messages generated by the Linux kernel itself. Stored in the kernel ring buffer
**\*tmp and lastlog**: These mechanisms record users logins and sessions.

It is important to note that syslog, rsyslog and auditd natively support remote logging. This allows configuration of the service to store the logs on a remote system.

### Common Linux Log Files

/var/log/messages
/var/log/lastlog
/var/log/wtmp
/var/log/utmp
/var/log/btmp
/var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log
/var/log/audit/audit.log
/var/log/dmesg
/var/log/journal
/var/log/account/pacct
