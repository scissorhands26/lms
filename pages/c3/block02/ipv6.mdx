| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 32-bit address space                        | 128-bit address space                       |
| Written in dotted-decimal format            | Written in hexadecimal format               |
| Includes broadcast addresses                | Uses multicast instead of broadcast         |
| Requires Network Address Translation (NAT)  | No NAT required                             |
| No built-in security features               | Built-in security features (IPsec)          |
| Supports manual and DHCP address assignment | Supports auto-configuration and renumbering |
| Prone to address exhaustion                 | Overcomes IPv4 address exhaustion           |
| Loopback address: 127.0.0.1                 | Loopback address: ::1                       |
| EX: 10.20.30.40                             | EX: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 |
